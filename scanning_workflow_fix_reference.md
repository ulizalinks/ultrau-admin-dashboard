# Scanning Services Workflow Fix - September 10, 2025

## Issue Summary
The CodeREADr scanning services creation was failing with error code 221: "The Postback URL is not valid"

## Root Cause
The system was using `localhost:5000` as a fallback URL for CodeREADr webhooks, which is not publicly accessible. CodeREADr requires HTTPS URLs that are reachable from the internet.

## Fix Applied
- **Before:** `${process.env.REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN || 'http://localhost:5000'}/api/codereadr/webhook`
- **After:** `${process.env.REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN}/api/codereadr/webhook`

## Files Modified
- `server/routes.ts` - Lines 352, 372, and 7759
- Removed localhost fallback for webhook URLs
- Now uses only the public Replit domain

## Test Results
- ✅ Server restarts successfully
- ✅ Webhook URLs now use public HTTPS domain
- ✅ Ready for scanning services recreation

## Next Steps for User
1. Return to Scanning Services for Kampala Music Festival 2025
2. Create scanning services again with Concert template
3. Should now successfully create all 3 services (Regular/VIP/VVIP)
4. Live monitoring should work properly

## CodeREADr Integration Status
- **Databases:** Already created (IDs: 1326790, 1326791, 1326792)
- **Services:** Need recreation with fixed webhook URLs
- **Tickets:** 17 tickets already synced to CodeREADr
