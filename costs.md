# Uliza Tickets - Cost Savings & Self-Hosting Guide

## üí∞ Ways to Save Money on Replit

### 1. Choose the Right Deployment Type

- **Static Deployments**: Free hosting + $0.10/GiB for data transfer (good for marketing pages)
- Your Core plan gives you **$25 monthly credits** before usage charges kick in

### 2. Cost Management Tools
- Set **budget limits** to prevent unexpected charges
- Enable **usage alerts** when spending reaches thresholds  
- Monitor costs in real-time via the Usage dashboard

### 3. Database Optimization
- PostgreSQL charges only when active (auto-suspends after 5 minutes idle)
- Configure history retention to reduce storage costs
- Each database has 33MB base cost even when empty
